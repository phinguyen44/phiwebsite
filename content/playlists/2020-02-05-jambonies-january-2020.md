I've been pretty heads down preparing for data science interviews (side note: HIRE ME!), so a more outsized presence from electronic music this month. The last one in particular was a favorite of my old flatmates in Berlin. But of course, a requisite appearance by Phoebe Bridgers.

1. Lewsberg - The Smile
2. Ethan Gruska - Enough for Now (feat. Phoebe Bridgers)
3. Japanese Breakfast - Essentially
4. Sidney Gish - Impostor Syndrome
5. Surf Curse - Disco
6. Ryley Walker - Spoil with the Rest
7. Aquaserge - Tour du monde
8. Mark Giuliana, Kesswa - BUD (Shigeto Mix)
9. DAVID AUGUST - A Golden Rush (feat. Nelia Kit)
10. Mira, Christopher Schwarzw√§lder - Leila
