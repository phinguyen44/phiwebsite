I'm a big fan of the Bundesliga, particularly supporting Borussia Dortmund. I made this `d3.js` graph after the completion of the 2014-2015 season, namely as a means to show the fast decline and slow ascent of Dortmund throughout the season.

The link to the actual interactive graphic can be found [here](../../bundesliga.html).
