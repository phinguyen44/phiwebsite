As a extension of [this graphic on the Bundesliga](../2014-2015-bundesliga-season-visualized), I wanted to allow for different metrics to be selected. In this graphic, you can select a metric, which changes the y-axis of the graph.

The link to the actual interactive graphic can be found [here](../../bundesligav2.html).
