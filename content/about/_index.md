Hi there! I'm a data scientist based in Berlin, Germany. I'm originally from the San Francisco Bay Area but moved out here to get my master's degree. I have a B.A. in Operations Research and Management Science from UC Berkeley and a M.S. in Statistics at the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin.

I have experience doing applied econometric research at a research institute as well as practical data science work at various start-ups and large companies in Silicon Valley and Berlin.

I'm most interested in the intersection between data science, (micro)econometrics, and data visualization, especially applied to the domains of urban, transport, climate change, labor, and housing economics.

## Commonly Used Apps

I work primarily in `R` using the `tidyverse` set of tools for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. I also have experiencing using `Python`, especially for building data pipelines and for some basic data science tasks, but I'm a bit rusty. `Visual Studio Code` is my text editor of choice. For reproducible documents, I use `RMarkdown`, `Bookdown`, and `LaTeX`. This website was build with `Blogdown`! I use `Zsh` with an `Oh-My-Zsh` configuration for my shell and use `Git` for version control.

In a past life, I was fairly proficient in each of these programs, but would need to brush up quite a bit before I would consider myself good-to-go. But I guess it's like riding a bike, am I right? `qGIS`, `Tableau`, `D3.js`, `Stata`, `R Shiny`, `Adobe Site Catalyst`

Outside of those, I just about always have these two apps open on my computer: `Notion` for all-purpose note-taking and `Spotify` for listening to tunes.
