Hi there! My name is Phi Nguyen. I studied Operations Research at UC Berkeley and Statistics at the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin. I'm most interested in the intersection between data science, econometrics, and data visualization, especially applied to the domains of urban, transport, and labor economics. Outside of work I can typically be found at the climbing gym, eating tater tots, or attending concerts.
