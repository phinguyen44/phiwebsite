Hi there! My name is Phi Nguyen & I'm a data scientist / statistician / plaintive soul from the Bay Area. I have a B.A. in Operations Research and Management Science from UC Berkeley and a M.S. in Statistics at the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin. I have experience doing econometric policy research as well as practical data science work at various start-ups and large companies in Silicon Valley and Berlin.

I'm most interested in the intersection between data science, (micro)econometrics, and data visualization, especially applied to the domains of urban, transport, climate change, labor, and housing economics. Lately I've also been reading a lot about algorithmic fairness.

Outside of work I can typically be found at the climbing gym, drinking a cup of coffee, or attending a concert (typically indie rock or electronic music).

## Commonly Used Apps

I work primarily in `R` using the `tidyverse` set of tools for data analysis, visualization, and modeling, but I am also proficient in `Python` and `SQL`. `Visual Studio Code` is my text editor of choice. For reproducible documents, I use `RMarkdown` `Markdown`, and `LaTeX`. This website was build with `Blogdown`! I use `Zsh` with an `Oh-My-Zsh` configuration for my shell and use `Git` for version control.

In a past life, I was fairly proficient in each of these programs, but would need to brush up quite a bit before I would consider myself good-to-go. But I guess it's like riding a bike, am I right? `qGIS`, `Tableau`, `D3.js`, `Stata`, `R Shiny`, `Adobe Site Catalyst`.

Outside of those, I just about always have these two apps open on my computer: `Notion` for all-purpose note-taking and `Spotify` for listening to tunes.
