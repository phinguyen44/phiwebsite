      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always a bit relunctant to write &amp;ldquo;End of Year&amp;rdquo; lists, since I&amp;rsquo;m hardly an authority on musical taste. I&amp;rsquo;m not a musician by any stretch of the imagination, nor have I ever really attempted to learn an instrument, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I could accurately judge the technical qualities of the albums either.
Then there is the whole creative aspect of the matter. How can one measure something that is inherently creative?</description>

      <description>My name, Phi, also represents the &amp;lsquo;golden ratio&amp;rsquo;: &amp;#934; = 1.618. This visualization graphically depicts the number, with each digit being represented by a color and unit vector in the polar coordinate system.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Bundesliga, particularly supporting Borussia Dortmund. I made this d3.js graph after the completion of the 2014-2015 season, namely as a means to show the fast decline and slow ascent of Dortmund throughout the season.

      <description>As a extension of this graphic on the Bundesliga, I wanted to allow for different metrics to be selected. In this graphic, you can select a metric, which changes the y-axis of the graph.
