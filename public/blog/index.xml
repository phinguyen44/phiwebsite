      <title>Working with Data Frames in Pandas, Part 1</title>

      <description>In the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on beefing up my data wrangling skills with Python and the pandas library. Coming primarily from an R background, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge advocate of the tidyverse family of packages (namely, dplyr for wrangling, tidyr for tidy data sets, and ggplot2 for plotting), from the great and powerful Hadley Wickham. For me, these packages heavily simplify data manipulation by providing a common &amp;ldquo;grammar&amp;rdquo; for which to operate on data, and for enabling method chaining using the pipe operator (%&amp;gt;%).</description>

      <title>Resampling Methods</title>

      <description>I once encountered an interview question that had completely bamboozled me at the time:
&amp;ldquo;Suppose you have a sequence \(X = {X_1, &amp;hellip;, X_N}\) of independently and identically distributed random variables drawn from the same unknown distribution. How would you estimate the variance of the sample median?&amp;rdquo;
In retrospect, the answer seems fairly obvious, but at the time I froze up. As a form of self-atonement, I wanted to answer this question in detail.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Decision Boundaries</title>

      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing a series of posts on interesting algorithms that I&amp;rsquo;ve either used in the past or intend to use in the future. Most of this stuff is fairly new to me or something I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored in depth, so please correct me if I am entirely off base. I fully believe that trying to explain a concept engenders a deeper understanding of said concept, so this is mostly a training tool for me!</description>

      <title>My Favorite Albums of 2019</title>
      <link>/blog/my-favorite-albums-of-2019/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always a bit relunctant to write &amp;ldquo;End of Year&amp;rdquo; lists, since I&amp;rsquo;m hardly an authority on musical taste. I&amp;rsquo;m not a musician by any stretch of the imagination, nor have I ever really attempted to learn an instrument, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I could accurately judge the technical qualities of the albums either.
Then there is the whole creative aspect of the matter. How can one measure something that is inherently creative?</description>

      <title>2014-2015 Bundesliga Season, Visualized</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-2015-bundesliga-season-visualized/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Bundesliga, particularly supporting Borussia Dortmund. I made this d3.js graph after the completion of the 2014-2015 season, namely as a means to show the fast decline and slow ascent of Dortmund throughout the season.

      <description>As a extension of this graphic on the Bundesliga, I wanted to allow for different metrics to be selected. In this graphic, you can select a metric, which changes the y-axis of the graph.

      <description>My name, Phi, also represents the &amp;lsquo;golden ratio&amp;rsquo;: &amp;#934; = 1.618. This visualization graphically depicts the number, with each digit being represented by a color and unit vector in the polar coordinate system.
