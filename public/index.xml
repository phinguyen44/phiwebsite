      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to source music from a broader set of sources (television, film). I recently saw the film &amp;ldquo;Jojo Rabbit&amp;rdquo; and fell in love with the music choices. I added a couple songs from the film onto this playlist. These songs are actually German versions of old hits. Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;m adding old and new tunes together. Previously I tried to stick to new releases, but I found that quest to daunting at times.</description>

      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing a series of posts on interesting algorithms that I&amp;rsquo;ve either used in the past or intend to use in the future. Most of this stuff is fairly new to me or something I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored in depth, so please correct me if I am entirely off base. I fully believe that trying to explain a concept engenders a deeper understanding of said concept, so this is mostly a training tool for me!</description>

      <title>My Favorite Albums of 2019</title>
      <link>/blog/my-favorite-albums-of-2019/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always a bit relunctant to write &amp;ldquo;End of Year&amp;rdquo; lists, since I&amp;rsquo;m hardly an authority on musical taste. I&amp;rsquo;m not a musician by any stretch of the imagination, nor have I ever really attempted to learn an instrument, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I could accurately judge the technical qualities of the albums either.
Then there is the whole creative aspect of the matter. How can one measure something that is inherently creative?</description>

      <title>2014-2015 Bundesliga Season, Visualized</title>
      <link>/blog/2014-2015-bundesliga-season-visualized/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Bundesliga, particularly supporting Borussia Dortmund. I made this d3.js graph after the completion of the 2014-2015 season, namely as a means to show the fast decline and slow ascent of Dortmund throughout the season.

      <description>As a extension of this graphic on the Bundesliga, I wanted to allow for different metrics to be selected. In this graphic, you can select a metric, which changes the y-axis of the graph.

      <description>My name, Phi, also represents the &amp;lsquo;golden ratio&amp;rsquo;: &amp;#934; = 1.618. This visualization graphically depicts the number, with each digit being represented by a color and unit vector in the polar coordinate system.
