      <description>I once encountered an interview question that had completely bamboozled me at the time:
&amp;ldquo;Suppose you have a sequence \(X = {X_1, &amp;hellip;, X_N}\) of independently and identically distributed random variables drawn from the same unknown distribution. How would you estimate the variance of the sample median?&amp;rdquo;
In retrospect, the answer seems fairly obvious, but at the time I froze up. As a form of self-atonement, I wanted to answer this question in detail.</description>

      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing a series of posts on interesting algorithms that I&amp;rsquo;ve either used in the past or intend to use in the future. Most of this stuff is fairly new to me or something I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored in depth, so please correct me if I am entirely off base. I fully believe that trying to explain a concept engenders a deeper understanding of said concept, so this is mostly a training tool for me!</description>
